This is the first project being assigned in AI enabled application development training by Coding The Brains.

The project requires detailed understanding of Loops, Conditions, Lists, Git and Github. Students are advised to
complete python crash course along with github training (https://youtu.be/2C4GWXVv55g) to be able to successfully execute the project.

Submission Method:

1. Students are required to create their github account and FORK the following git repository:
    https://github.com/Awaismaz/minesweeper_project.git

2. Watch https://youtu.be/2C4GWXVv55g to understand the Forking Process if you are unable to understand STEP 1

3. Add a new file with your own name in the format firstname_lastname.py
4. The structure of code is present in awais_mazahir.py. Copy the code to newly created file and build your function
5. Once results are correct, push your code to your github account and initiate a pull request by clicking on "Contribute" Button
6. Perform the changes in main branch only.

Code Requirements:

1. You are required to create logic of minesweeper game. 
2. Input received by your function will be will be a VARIABLE SIZED List.
3. Every location where mine is present 'X' (alphabet) is marked. 'O' (alphabet) is marked where mine is not present
4. For each location, you need to find, how many mines are present in neighbouring cells
5. If mine is present in a cell, the output of the cell remains 'X'
6. If mine is not present in a cell, its value will be replaced by a number depicting the mines present in 8 neighbouts
7. Desired output of the function for given test input is shown in awais_mazahir.py file
8. Your function will be tested against hidden input to verify that your code i

Good Luck!!
